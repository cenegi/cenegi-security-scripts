# Cenegi Security Scripts

Small collection of security / automation scripts I use in my personal lab environment:

- Recon helpers (wrappers around tools like nmap).
- Log and evidence collection helpers for investigations.
- Reporting / note-taking utilities for penetration testing and incident response.

> For lab / educational use only. Always obtain written authorization before testing any environment.
